# Homework-Note-Taker
A note taking app for writing and saving notes using an Express.js back end that saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

We were given the following acceptance criteria:
```md
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

```
- **What was your motivation?**
```md
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

```
  
- **Why did you build this project?**
I built this project to practice creating and using Express routes. Using the example of a note taker app, I wanted to gain an understanding of creating and deleting data on the back end.

- **What problem does it solve?**
This allows a user to take notes for business or personal reminders or to-do lists.

- **What did you learn?**
I learned how to use Express to create an API with GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes then fetch the data on the front end.

- **What challenges did you encounter?**
Deploying to Heroku.
